Git Flow
======
1) Make sure you are using `git pull --rebase` to pull changes, fixing merge
conflicts before you push. To set this up automatically, do ```git config
branch.autosetuprebase always```

2) No branch/pull requests, since we are doing rebase on master, master should
always be up to date and free of merge conflits
